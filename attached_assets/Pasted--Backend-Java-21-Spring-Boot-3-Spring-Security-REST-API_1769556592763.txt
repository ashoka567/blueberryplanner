    * Backend: Java 21, Spring Boot 3, Spring Security, REST API
    * Frontend: Angular (latest LTS) + Angular Material
    * DB: MongoDB
    * Auth: JWT (access + refresh), separate logins
    * Include: security, audit logs, monitoring
* Use only Path A (simplest free hosting) for deployment.
* Functional scope (MVP)
* Calendar events + medication adherence (taken/skipped/missed + escalation) + groceries + chores + kids homework. Multi-tenant Family/Household with roles (GUARDIAN, MEMBER) and multiple dependents.
* 
* What to produce (in this exact order)
* 1) Repo structure decision (mono-repo vs two repos)
    * Recommend one approach and justify it for an MVP.
    * Provide the exact folder layout.
* Include shared docs for environment variables and local setup.
* 2) Local development setup
* Provide a sample docker-compose.yml (and any needed .env examples) to run locally:
    * MongoDB
    * Mongo Express (optional)
    * Backend Spring Boot (or explain how to run it from IDE while Mongo runs in Docker)
* (Optional) a reverse proxy if helpful, but keep it simple/free.
* Also include:
    * backend application.yml key placeholders (JWT secret, Mongo URI, CORS origins)
* Angular environment.ts placeholders for API base URL
* 3) Path A deployment plan (free-tier friendly, step-by-step)
* Use these specific choices unless you have a better free alternative:
    * Frontend hosting: Cloudflare Pages (free) (or GitHub Pages if simpler—pick one and stick to it)
    * Backend hosting: Render free tier (or Fly.io free allowance—pick one and stick to it)
* Database hosting: MongoDB Atlas free tier (M0)
* Include detailed steps:
    * Create accounts/projects
    * Build commands for Angular + Spring Boot
    * Configure environment variables/secrets on the host
    * CORS configuration between SPA and API
    * Set up custom domain WPCLife.com:
        * DNS records needed for frontend and API (e.g., wpclife.com and api.wpclife.com)
        * TLS/HTTPS handling
    * Basic CI/CD using GitHub Actions (free):
        * workflow for Angular deploy to chosen host
* workflow for Spring Boot deploy to chosen host
* 4) Production configuration checklist
* Provide a checklist for go-live, including:
    * Security headers, CORS, rate limiting guidance
    * JWT rotation/refresh token storage choice
    * Password hashing
    * Audit logging enabled and protected (guardian-only access)
    * Monitoring enabled: Actuator endpoints exposure rules, health checks
    * Backups strategy for MongoDB Atlas free tier (limitations + workaround)
* Log retention approach in free tiers
* 5) Limitations / risks of free tiers
* List concrete risks and mitigations for:
    * sleeping instances / cold starts (backend)
    * quotas (requests, bandwidth, build minutes)
    * database storage/connection limits (Atlas M0)
    * email/invite flows (if not available)
    * push notifications (note what can be postponed if mobile isn’t in MVP)
* domain/DNS propagation issues
* Constraints
    * REST only (no GraphQL)
    * Free/open-source libraries + free hosting tiers
